####  ** _Note: For Proof-Read Only_

In previous post, we established that a mutating virus presents a unique challenge to drug developer. So intuitively, I try to look into a viable solution that would be effective against viral outbreak regardless of the mutational factor. Understanding that vaccine and antiviral tends to be specific, I explore the possibility of a more broad spectrum solution, one that harms invading virus and possibly the host at the same time but is much more harmful to the virus. When outside of the host, virus is vulnerable to many things. If one wish to destroy virus in a petri dish , one can:
- apply bleach to viral solution, 
- heat the viral solution to 60&#8451; or even higher, 
- use electricity to cause extreme electroporation across the membrane hence rupturing it
- radiate with ultraviolet light to break the virus gene

Intuitively, the candidates are chemical, heat, radiation, and electricity. It is easy to see there's many things that can kill a virus outside the host, but it's completely different matter about killing virus inside the host. One may think any of the potential solutions mentioned is more likely to kill **both** the virus and the host. But as I look further into each of the candidates, I suprisingly found a viable candidate: electricity

## Biocompatible Electricity

Biocompatible electricity is best described as electricity exposure in which human body can tolerate for long period. The term of biocompatible electricity was first mentioned in 1991 study done at Albert Einstein College of Medicine by a team of 3 researchers: Professor William D. Lyman, Dr Irwin R. Merkatz, and Dr. Steven G. Kaali. 

Their paper titled [_"Biocompatible Electric Current Attenuates HIV Infectivity"_][journal-LymanAtAl] describe <span class="tooltip" data-key="inVitro">in vitro</span> experiments where direct electric current at microcurrent intensity was applied to a solution of HIV-1 virus and <span data-key="H9Cell" class="tooltip">[H9 cells][info1]</span> separately. The study found a **statistically significant reduction in <span class="tooltip" data-key="ReverseTranscriptase">[reverse transcriptase][info2]</span>** activity when HIV virus was mixed with the H9 cells. This translates to **attenuated infectivity** of HIV virus. [Lyman At Al][journal-LymanAtAl] hypothesised that electric current might somehow damaged reverse transcriptase enzyme, hence rendering HIV-1 virus unable to replicate inside the H9 cells. On the other hand, H9 cells treated with similar treatment were still viable.

Below are some excerpts and images taken from the paper that describe the findings:
> ### Reverse Transcriptase Assays  
>  
> The direct electric currents to which HIV was exposed also reduced reverse transcriptase activity. **.......**  
, there was a significant decrease in the amount of reverse transcriptase activity after exposure of the virus to either 50 &#xb5;A for 3 or 6 minutes **.......**  
near ablation of reverse transcriptase acivity was seen with exposure of the viral isolate to 100 &#xb5;A for 6 minutes. **.......**  
An analysis of variance indicate the decrease in reverse transcriptase activity was statistically significant (p < 0.0001)

It is fair to say that the findings of electric current can damage virus ability to infect might be only applicable to retrovirus as one of a kind. But the principle of eliminating / disabling virus using electricity has also been used and studied in botany. There are <span class="tooltip" data-key="inVivo">in vivo</span> studies that demonstrate electricity is shown to be able to eliminate virus in [potatoes][journal2], [banana][journal5], [yellow bean cormels][journal3], and [garlic][journal4] while leaving the seddlings healthier and free of viral infection. Although these botany studies uses milliAmpere current  which is 1000 times of &#xb5;A, but it gives credence that certain level of electricity can damage to virus in general, and more over it was achieved in <span class="tooltip" data-key="inVivo"> in vivo</span>. 

Also worth mentioning is a collaboration paper between Novo Biotic Limited, NovoCure Ltd and Technion-Israel Institute of Technology published in American Society for Microbiology in Aug 2010. The paper published by [Giladi at al titled: _"Mircobial Growth Inhibition by Alternating Electric Fields in Mice with Pseudomonas aeruginosa Lung Infection"_][journal-GiladiAtAl], explored the effect of low intensity but high frequency (in MHz range) <span class="tooltip" data-key="AC">AC</span> electric fields for inhibiting bacterial growth on mice's lung.

[Giladi at al][journal-GiladiAtAl] found that alternating electric field alone has inhibitory effect on bacterial growth
Even though [Giladi at al][journal-GiladiAtAl]'s study was on inhibiting bacterial growth using electrical field, but an important fact need to be drawn here are that the study was done as <span class="tooltip" data-key="inVivo">in vivo</span> study on anesthesized mice and it was applied to the chest regions (where electrically sensistive heart is located). Furthermore the electric field was applied for 48 hours with 2 breaks in between to check on mice's condition. This shows it is feasible to conduct similar <span class="tooltip" data-key="inVivo">in vivo</span> study for the effect of biocompatible electricity.

<sup>source: [Giladi at al][journal-GiladiAtAl]</sup>

[Lyman at al][journal-LymanAtAl] concluded that the attenuation effect is proportional to the strength and time exposure. But if one were to apply the same study on whole human body, we need to look at specifically <span class="tooltip" data-key="currentDensity">current density</span> instead of total current, because that's what most likely matter down at cellular level. So we should reconclude that **attenuation effect of electricity is directly porportional to current density and time exposure** 

Exceprt from [Lyman at al][journal-LymanAtAl] describing the setup:
> ## Electrical Treatment of HIV   
> The RF strain of HIV (AIDS Reagent Program) was cryopreserved prior to treatment at -70&#8451;. For treatment, a sample of virus was thawed and maintained on ice at 4&#8451;. Ten microliters (&#xb5;L) of HIV at a concentration of 10<sup>5</sup> infectious particles per mL were placed into a chamber which included a pair of platinum electrodes 1 mm apart permanently mounted into a well 1.56 mm in length and 8.32 mm in depth equal to 12.9 &#xb5;L volume capacity. The chamber was connected to a power supply capable of creating constant direct current.The viral aliquots were exposed to direct currents ranging from 0 microamperes (&#xb5;A) for up to 12 minutes to 100 &#xb5;A for up to 6 minutes.

The cross sectional area would be 8.32mm x 1.56mm = 12.9 mm<sup>2</sup>. With current of 50 - 100 &#xb5;A, this would gives current density at **3.85 - 7.7 &#xb5;A/mm<sup>2</sup>**.


## How electricity affect humans body?

Now that we understood the effect of biocompatible electricity on virus from past studies, we need to first understand how electricity affect human's body

First, we look into the fatal side effect of electricity. Then we look at the possible side effect of prolonged exposure of electricity to human body

### Fatal side effect of electrical Power

Table below shows the intensity of electric current vs body's reaction  
<img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-99fd4427874351be185929c5de2a448d" width="395" height="262">

The following excerpts taken from [Wikipedia][info3]:
> The United States National Library of Medicine states: "Contact with 20 mA of current can be fatal".
> 
> The health hazard of an electric current flowing through the body **depends on the amount of current and the length of time for which it flows**, not merely on the voltage. However, a high voltage is required to produce a high current through the body. This is due to the relatively high resistance of skin when dry, requiring a high voltage to pass through. The severity of a shock also depends on whether the path of the current includes a vital organ. 
> **......**  
>
> Whether an electric current is fatal is also dependent on the path it takes through the body, which depends in turn on the points at which the current enters and leaves the body. The current path **must usually include either the heart or the brain** to be fatal. 

If one wish to apply biocompatible electric current to the targeted part of human's body, there are several things to be careful about:
- the total electric current must be below the fatal milliAmpere strength
- the path of electric current must avoid heart and brain. Restriction may also apply to pacemakers user and other similar bionic implanted devices.
- the electric potential applied must not be too great that it overcome natural skin resistivity and causing high current flowing

Next we look at the potential side effect of prolonged exposure to electricity

### Prolonged effect of electricity exposure

Now that we establish the non-fatal limit of electricity on human body, we need to look into what are the prolonged effect of exposing electricity to human body. The well known effects are:
- [electrolysis][info4]
- [transfection][info5] via [electroporation][info6]
- potential [biocides][info7]

First is [electrolysis][info4]. Up to 60% of the body is made of water (H<sub>2</sub>O). One of the well known effect of applying electricty on water is electrolysis. When constant static electric field is applied to water, each Hydrogen and Oxygen's pole end of water will be attracted to polar opposite of the electric field. If enough strength is applied, it will break the molecular bond, and form hydrogen and oxygen gas on each end of the electric field. The theoretical decomposition potential of water is 1.23V, although in practice you would higher voltage[[info][info9]]

The effect of electrolysis on blood has been used, for example: treating [aneurysm][info10] by closing the sac with blood clot using [Guglielmi Detachable Coil][info11]. Electrolysis is also one of the utilised mode in [electrosurgery][info12].

Second is [transfection][info5] via [electroporation][info6] method. Direct electric field could cause the surface membrane of the cell to be stretched, hence making intransient pores by which (internal or external) substance to pass through the cell. This could cause cell to absorb or lose substance too much and too fast, hence causing cell's death.

Electroporation is widely used in microbiology research to introduce substance into cells, for example: for producing <span class="tooltip" data-key="knockoutMouse">[knockout mices][info13]</span> in medical research or to introduce new coding DNA into cell for genetic research. Typical voltage requirement for electroporation is a very short-pulsed but high voltage (1 to 2 kV).

Third is potential biocides. In the practical application of electricity onto human body, metallic electrodes are often used. When electric current flows metal comes in contact with internal body's fluids (like for example: blood), unwanted chemical compound and formation of metalic ion could be formed at the electrode surface. Overtime, such chemical release can be poisonous for body. Most common metal used as electrode are platinum, copper, and stainless steel. 

## Minimising biocompatible electricity side effect

Lyman et al. study showed that an average of 94% infectivity's attenuation of HIV-1 virus can be achieved by 100 &#xb5;A direct current (current density of ~ 7.7 &#xb5;A/mm<sup>2</sup>) for 6 minute exposure. Using this number as a guide, let us see how we can minimise the side effect, and asses whether 6 minutes exposure of 7.7&#xb5;A/mm<sup>2</sup>  is reasonably safe.

The fatal risk is obvious and can be managed safely by limiting the strength and avoiding high risk area.  Electrolysis effect can be minimised by minimising time exposure and also using <span data-key="AC" class="tooltip">AC</span> field with lowest acceptable strength. With AC field, the polarity switched over time hence not very effective at electrolysing water. Given the use of AC field, we can also safely used an innert or non invasive electrode to prevent biocides release.

Understandably by using AC field, we also need to minimise the effect of transfection. To do this we need to look into [Xie at al's _Study of mechanisms of electric field-induced DNA transfection II_][journal-XieAtAl]. Xie at al investigated the feasibility of using lower strength AC electric field instead of the usual high powered DC field to achieve DNA transfection while keeping the targeted cell viable. 

[Xie at al][journal-XieAtAl] found for a given fixed strength AC signal, the transfection efficiency follows an asymmetric bell curve where transfection efficiency diminished, as frequency applied is higher than the peak. Higher amplitude also means higher peak transfection frequency. [Xie at al][journal-XieAtAl] also demonstrated that transfection efficiency goes from low to high proportionally as they switched from triangular to sinusoidal to square wave.

Furthermore, [Xie at al][journal-XieAtAl] also quoted similar study where low power, low frequency AC field were applied to human's <span data-key="erythorcyte" class="tooltip">erythrocytes</span> for hours does not undergoes significant physiological or morphological effect, and any effect on its membrane is reversible.

These are the excerpt and transfection graph from [Xie at al][journal-XieAtAl]:
> Previously, Teissie and Tsong (30) and Serpersu and Tsong (31) have shown that reversible activation of certain membrane channels or transport systems may be achieved using low-amplitude, low-frequency ac fields. Electric fields as small as 16 V/cm have been shown to induce membrane conductance, and these effects were completely reversible. Human erythrocytes treated with such ac fields for hours
were shown to have normal shape, volume, and permeabilities to K+ and Na+ (30, 31)

## So what we have got so far

So understanding all these requirements and theory, we can summarise the feasibility and criteria for practical application:
- current density strength of 3.85 - 7.7 &#xb5;A/mm<sup>2</sup> at targeted area
- total current shouldn't exceed 10 mA or even lower for patient with underlying neurological disease
- the electric current shouldn't past brain or heart, and potentially unusable for patients with pacemaker/bionic device
- To minimise transfection and electrolysis, AC field (triangular, sinusoidal, or square wave) should be used

The method of delivery availables are invasive/intravenous, current delivery via external electrode, and electric current induction. Each have its advantages and limitation.

## Author's Conclusion

To fellow readers, **please do not try to electrocute yourself to cure a viral disease**. People can die from electrocution. The purpose of this article is to explore the working of biocompatible electricity along with its potential side effect, and investigating methods to minimise the side effect while maximizing damage to pathogenic virus.

[There are many prototype drug that are proven to be working in in vitro experiment, but when used in in vivo trial, the efficacy seems to be neutralised or proven to be too toxic to human's body][info15]. But I believe biocompatible electricity holds the key to fighting viral disease. The amount of studies that shows how bio electricity flows in human body to maintain healthy function proves that human body indeed can tolerate electricity to a certain degree and applying the effect of biocompatible electricity to human is highly feasible. Given the low strength required by biocompatible electricity to be effective against viral disease shows the real possibility that this effect could be standardised and used in pandemic caused by viral disease.   

Understandably there are some missing hole in the practical application, such as the need for human in vivo study. Given current [report][news1] that patient who recovered from COVID-19 seems to have lower or insufficient antibodies which undermines potential efficacy of the vaccine, I believe medical community should also investigate the unexplored potential of biocompatible electricity.
