This is the first post in the first blog I ever made.
I usually couldn't be bothered to maintain a blog but a once a life time experience compels me to start this blog

On January 2020, my family and I went to Wuhan to visit my wife's family. It was supposed to be a happy occasion where family members gather and celebrate Chinese New Year together.

But a pandemic struck and ruined our holiday. It started in Wuhan and ruins so many life. In case, anyone still wonder what is this pandemic, it's called [Covid-19](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019).

We were lucky not to be infected by this virus and we were evacuated by Australia from the epicentre of this epidemic.  Eventually we were quarantined in Manigurr-ma village just outside Howard Spring, Darwin

The whole experience has caused stress and fear in our life. But as I went through lockdown in Wuhan and then quarantine in Darwin, a question comes into the mind that compels me to search for an answer. 

It has been just over 100 years since [1918 flu pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu) till Covid-19 pandemic. So a question arose in my mind on what has humanity has discovered and found that could help stave off the next deadly outbreak. The next one may spell the end of humanity as a species. That is the question this blog will try to answer.
