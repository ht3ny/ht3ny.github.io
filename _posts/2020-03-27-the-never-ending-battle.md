There’s a war that human has never stopped fighting. The tragedy and loss of life is even greater  than the tragic result of World War I and II combined. It’s a holy war filled with mythology and superstition. It’s the fight between human and pathogens. 

Earth hosts many different type of microorganism. Microorganism is essential to human's body. For example: bacteria that lives in our gut helps to break down food into nutrients that our body can absorb. This kind of relationship is called symbiosis. In the case of gut bacteria, the relationship is mutualistic, gut bacteria gets food and place to live, while our body gets the essential nutrients.  

Unfortunately there are also microorganisms that don't enter into mutualistic relationship with our body. When they enter human body, they cause harms and quite often death. These type of organisms are called [pathogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen) or germs for simplicity. As consequence, human body develops a complex immune system to deal with germs. For example:
- Skin stops pathogens and contaminant from coming into our body.
- Nose has hair and mucus that traps contaminant and pathogens.
- Stomach is filled with acid intended to break down food and kill pathogens at the same time
- The body can raise temperature (hence fever) to try to heat these pathogens and activate antibodies production
- Antibodies block these pathogens from damaging the bodies
- The white blood cells can ingest pathogens or release enzymes that digest pathogens

There are many other methods that our immune system uses, but we need to realise our immune system is not perfect (some may call it work in progress) and when it fail, it comes with deadly consequence. 

For millennia, human has aided immune system with medicines, supplement, herb, acupuncture, and other treatment. There are many types of germs, e.g: bacteria, virus, worms, and fleas. For each type, medical community has discovered treatement / medication that are quite effective. As example, against bacteria, we discovered antibiotic and herbs that has effective antibacterial agent. Against parasitic worms, we have herb, medicine, and treatments that are effective. However we never found a class of treatment / medication that are truly effective against virus, like antibiotics for bacteria. When you fell ill from viral infection, doctors usually advise you to rest and some medication to treat the symptoms. Often antibiotic is prescribed to prevent secondary infection from bacteria

Virus can cause deadly diseases that are very infectious, e.g: SARS, Ebola, MERS, Lassa, HIV, and others. Symptoms caused by viral disease often do not manifest because virus can incubate in the body. For example, HIV can incubate for many months before the infected person realised there’s something wrong. We never discovered the silver bullet against virus due to the fact virus don’t work in the same way as bacteria and other parasites. Once a virus enters human body, it will try to infect the host's cell. And essentially the reproduction system of the cell is hijacked and becomes a new factory to produce more virus to infect more cells. 

Currently the best mechanism we have against virus is still our immune system. We try to aid our body fight against virus with vaccination (takes long time to develop and often does not give immunity for long) and antiviral (often hard to develop and difficult to make and not always effective). When virus mutates, what was once an effective antiviral or vaccination may be rendered useless. Also virus mutates faster than we can develop antiviral and vaccine. 

At time of this writing, we have COVID-19 outbreak around the world that are damaging social fabric around the world. COVID-19 has some characteristics that makes it hard to contains. The disease can have very long incubation period (average is said to be 4 days and can be up to 24 days). At early stage, the symptoms are like common cold, making it difficult to diagnose, and also reportedly no symptoms at all. Some scientists and mathematicians even predicted that COVID-19 will stay and become seasonal flu. 

If you are pessimists, you may feel there’s no hope in this never ending war. But it is said behind a crisis there is also an opportunity. Now around the world, brilliant minds and medical professionals gather together to find the solution to this outbreak. Could this outbreak be also an opportunity that help humanity discover the much needed silver bullet against pathogenic virus?
