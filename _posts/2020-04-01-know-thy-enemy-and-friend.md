In previous post, we came to a realization that we haven’t found the silver bullet against pathogenic virus. So if one wish to find the silver bullet, it is best to study and understand what is virus.

## What Is Virus

Virus is a very strange biological form. It’s not considered to be alive by the elementary biology’s definition of living organism. Virus does not appears to have metabolism and their sole purpose of existence appears to be for transferring genetic material into their host. Virus usually target a specific type of cell of certain organism (also called as host). Not all virus can infect humans, but some does. Some virus that infect human also originate from animals. Such virus is called as zoonotic origin virus. Example: H5N1 or bird flu can jump from birds to humans if enough exposure. Likewise virus can also jump from humans to animals

Virus is composed of a genetic material which is coated by protein (capsid). It replicates by injecting its genetic material into host's cell and hijacked cell's protein synthesis process to create more virus 

You can simply classify virus based on the genetic material inside the capsid: DNA and RNA. DNA is a double stranded molecule that stores genetic information, while RNA is a simpler single stranded molecule that plays role in protein formation inside the cell. There are more standardised classification of virus (see [ICTV and Baltimore classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus_classification)) but we will use a simpler classification for the purpose of seeing the impact of RNA and DNA virus on its lifecyle.

Both RNA and DNA are genetic materials and it can undergoes copying process to replicate the genetic material. However there's one feature in DNA replication process that distinquish RNA virus from DNA virus. The copying process of genetic material is facilitated by a class of enzyme called polymerase, but polymerase does makes mistake during copying process, and this could lead to mutations. However one of the enzyme involved in DNA replication called as exonucleause gives proofreading ability, meaning it can identify the incorrect insertion, and then correct it by inserting the right base. On the other hand, RNA replication process lacks such proofreading enzyme, hence incorrect insertion during RNA copying process is not fixable, and leads to higher tendencies of mutation in RNA virus. Not all mutations would lead to more dangerous virus, but it could allows virus to evolve with different protein encodings, hence resistance to current medication

> Even though DNA polymerases have proofreading abilities, they still make mistakes – on the order of about one misincorporation per 107 to 109 nucleotides polymerized. But the RNA polymerases of RNA viruses are the kings of errors – these enzymes screw up as often as one time for every 1,000 – 100,000 nucleotides polymerized. This high rate of mutation comes from the lack of proofreading ability in RNA polymerases. These enzymes make mistakes, but they can’t correct them. Therefore the mutations remain in the newly synthesized RNA.

Here's a list of well known DNA and RNA virus
| Genetic Material | Example of Virus                                  |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| DNA              | smallpox, polio, chickenpox, herpes, Epstein-Barr |
| RNA              | influenza, HIV-1, SARS, rotavirus, Ebola          |

## Available Medication And Theraphy

Now that we understand how virus works. Next we need to understand the tools are available in the medical community to combat viral disease. There are a lot of medications that are used to fight viral disases, but we will cover only 3 of them that had made news headlines in fights against COVID-19 pandemic.

### Vaccine

The idea of vaccination or innoculation is to teach body to develop immunity with weakened pathogen, so the body would be able to recognize and fight the wild pathogen effectively when it hits. 

[![Chinese Work on vaccination](https://media.historyofvaccines.org/images/000012_540.jpg)](https://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/early-chinese-inoculation)  
<sup>Source: [historyofvaccines.org](https://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/early-chinese-inoculation)</sup>

The earliest record of successful mass vaccination is from 15th century in China, where people were innoculated for smallpox. The technique have 0.5-2% death rate, but it's much less than 20-30% mortality rate from the wild smallpox. It was first successful proof of the idea behind vaccination.

There are generally 3 class of vaccine based on the antigen (toxin used to induce an immune response) component: live attenuated, deactivated, and subunit/conjugated. To learn more about how these types of vaccine works, please visit [History of Vaccines](https://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/articles/different-types-vaccines).

Vaccination remains as primary technique for preventing outbreak. Successful vaccination campaign has also helped to eradicate smallpox and polio.

### Antiviral

Antiviral is a class of drugs that target virus and works in the same principle of antibiotic (which targets bacteria). In principle, antiviral is designed to disrupt virus life cycle, i.e: before virus enter a cell, after virus enter cell, during virus assembly, and during virus release phase.

There are natural antivirals, such as allicin in garlic, Australian tea tree oil, and eucalyptus oil. Researcher has also discovered multiple antiviral in traditional herbal treatment. Though most of the antiviral used in hopsital is designer drug (not found in nature and usually designed to target specific class of virus and for targeting specific phase of virus lifecycle), example: oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and pleconaril.     

### Interferon

Interferons are proteins that are made and released by the host cells in the presence of virus. It acts as signaling molecule to nearby cells to heighten their anti viral defense. In simpler terms, interferons are responsible for activating and heightening body's immune system against viral infection.

With recent COVID-19 pandemic, interferons drug are becoming frontline medication against SARS-COV-2. Interferon alfa-2B, which was developed and manufactured in Cuba is now one of the drugs used in China for treating COVID-19 patients<sup>[[1]()]</sup>. In January 2020, Russia named 3 medications for treating COVID-19 patient, and one of them is an interferon class drug <sup>[[2]()]</sup>

## Limitation

Now we need to evaluate how effective are the available tools against viral disease, and also how virus adapt to deal with the medication.

### Vaccine
Vaccine remains as a primary tools against viral disease outbreak. Effective vaccination would lead to a long lasting herd immunity. Herd immunity is the situation where majority of population has developed immunity to the targeted virus, and hence eradicating its spread in the community. With vaccination, humans have managed to stop the spread of and eradicated some of the viral disease, such as polio and smallpox. Like a saying goes: it's better to prevent than to cure, vaccination remains useful for preventing outbreak. 

But the development and manufacturing of vaccine comes at extraordinary effort. It takes long time (usually in several years) before an effective vaccine can be developed. This is because an ineffective vaccine can cause more damage than the virus itself, hence the time required to conduct tests on animals then humans before it can be declared to be safe. There is also concern about safety over vaccines that is mass produced. One of the most famous example is the Cutter's incident. In 1960s, some batches of inactivated polio vaccines produced by Cutter Laboratories was found to cause actual polio cases. It was found that the batches contains improperly inactivated polio virus and lead to over 40,000 cases of polio. CDC maintained a list of [safety concerns over vaccines](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/concerns-history.html) since 1960s if one is interested. The key lesson here is developing vaccine and mass-producing one is a very challenging process, hence why vaccines development and manufacturing has to follow very strict guidelines.

### Antiviral
Antiviral development is relatively newer compared to development of antibiotics. Penicillin, the first medically used antibiotics, was found in 1928 and started to being used medically in 1930s. In comparison, the first medically used antiviral, [aciclovir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aciclovir) was discovered in 1971, and not approved for medical use until 1981. 

There are several main hurdles of development of new antiviral, and they are:  
1. Most of the testing for antiviral is done in vitro or animal experimentation.  
An effective antiviral in lab settings doesn't always have the same efficacy in human's trial
2. The toxicity of antiviral is not always tolerated by the bodies
4. To yield a more effective & less toxic antiviral, it is now very common for the drug developer to design the antiviral to be highly specific on the target, such as targetting specific receptor membrane protein of a speicfic class of virus. As such, the development takes a lot of money and costly and reduce the usage's scope of such designer antiviral

This led some antiviral medication to be a very costly, because the market for such antiviral is considerably niche and pharmaceutical company need to recoup the cost of development, hence such antivirals are not usually mass produced.

### Virus fights back
Lastly there's a challenge presented by virus lifecycle. There are 2 main avenues for virus to undergoes significant mutation: [antigenic shift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigenic_shift) and [antigenic drift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigenic_drift).

Antigenic shift is the process where 2 or more different strain of a the same virus or different virus combine and causing rearrangement of the surface proteins of the virus. This can lead to new emergence of viral pathogen. The process is more prominent with zoonotic virus, e.g: influenza A can infects humans, mammals, and avian. This gives zoonotic virus such as Influenza A more chances to undergoes this process and leading to more radically different strains.

In contrast, antigenic drift is an evolutionary process where enough mutations in the virus genes that codes the surface proteins (that the host antibodies usually recognize) lead to a new strain of virus where it cannot be inhibited by host's exisiting antibodies. It is one of the most common way for influenza virus to change.

When weighing the time taken for developing new vaccine or antiviral, it is safe to say virus, especially RNA virus can mutate faster than we can actually develop a medication against the new strains or mutation
