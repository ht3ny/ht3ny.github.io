In previous post, we established that a mutating virus presents a unique challenge to drug developer. So intuitively, I try to look into a viable solution that would be effective against viral outbreak regardless of the mutational factor. Understanding that vaccine and antiviral tends to be specific, I explore the possibility of a more broad spectrum solution, one that harms the body and virus at the same time but is much more harmful to the virus. When outside of the host, virus is vulnerable to many things. If one wish to destroy virus in a petri dish (in in vitro environment), one can:
- apply bleach to viral solution, 
- heat the viral solution to 60&#8451; or even higher, 
- use electricity to cause extreme electroporation across the membrane hence rupturing it
- radiate with ultraviolet light to break the virus gene

Intuitively, the candidates are chemical, heat, radiation, and electricity. It is easy to see there's many things that can kill a virus outside the host, but it's completely different matter about killing virus inside the host. One may think any of the potential solutions mentioned is more likely to kill **both** the virus and the host. But as I look further into each of the candidates, I suprisingly found a viable candidate: electricity

## Biocompatible Electricity

Biocompatible electricity is described as electricity exposure in which human body can tolerate for long period. The term of biocompatible electricity was first mentioned in 1991 study done at Albert Einstein College of Medicine by a team of 3 researchers: Professor William D. Lyman, Dr Irwin R. Merkatz, and Dr. Steven G. Kaali. 

Their paper titled _"Biocompatible Electric Current Attenuates HIV Infectivity"_ describe in vitro experiments where direct electric current at microcurrent level was applied to a solution of HIV-1 virus and 
<span class="tooltip">[H9 cells][info1]
  <span class="tooltiptext" id="H9Cell"></span>
</span> separately. 
The study found a **statistically significant reduction in 
<span class="tooltip">[reverse transcriptase][info2]
  <span class="tooltiptext" id="ReverseTranscriptase"></span>
</span>** activity when HIV virus was mixed with the H9 cells. This translates to **attenuated infectivity** of HIV virus. The researchers hypothesised that electric current might somehow damaged reverse transcriptase enzyme, hence rendering HIV-1 virus unable to replicate inside the H9 cells. On the other hand, H9 cells treated with similar treatment were still viable and no significant temperature (no more than 1&#8451;) were observed.

Below are some excerpts and images taken from the paper that describe the findings:

, there was a significant decrease in the amount of reverse transcriptase activity after exposure of the virus to either 50 &#xb5;A for 3 or 6 minutes **.......**  
near ablation of reverse transcriptase acivity was seen with exposure of the viral isolate yo 100 &#xb5;A for 6 minutes. **.......**  
An analysis of variance indicate the decrease in reverse transcriptase activity was statistically significant (p < 0.0001)

It is fair to say that the findings of electric current can damage virus ability to infect might be only applicable to  retrovirus as one of a kind. But the principle of eliminating / disabling virus using electricity has also been used and studied in botany. There are studies to demonstrated that electricity is shown to be able to eliminate virus in [potatoes][journal2], [banana][journal5], [yellow bean cormels][journal3], and [garlic][journal4] while leaving the seddlings healthier and free of viral infection. Although these botany studies uses milliAmpere strength, which is 1000 times stronger than &#xb5;A, but it confirm in practice, that biocompatible electricity can be achieved for different type of organism where it would harm the virus more than the host

## How electricity affect humans body?

Now that we understood the effect of biocompatible electricity on virus from past studies, we need to first understand how electricity affect human's body

First, we look into the fatal side effect of electricity. Then we look at the possible side effect of prolonged exposure of electricity to human body

### Fatal side effect of electrical Power

Table below shows the strength of current vs body's reaction  
<img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-99fd4427874351be185929c5de2a448d" width="395" height="262">

The following excerpts taken from [Wikipedia][info3]:
> The United States National Library of Medicine states: "Contact with 20 mA of current can be fatal".
> 
> The health hazard of an electric current flowing through the body **depends on the amount of current and the length of time for which it flows**, not merely on the voltage. However, a high voltage is required to produce a high current through the body. This is due to the relatively high resistance of skin when dry, requiring a high voltage to pass through. The severity of a shock also depends on whether the path of the current includes a vital organ. 
> **......**  
>
> Whether an electric current is fatal is also dependent on the path it takes through the body, which depends in turn on the points at which the current enters and leaves the body. The current path **must usually include either the heart or the brain** to be fatal. 

If one wish to apply biocompatible electric current to the targeted part of human's body, there are several things to be careful about:
- the strength of the electric current must be below milliAmpere strength
- the path of electric current must avoid heart and brain. Restriction may also apply to pacemakers user and other similar bionic implanted devices.
- the electric potential applied must not be too great that it overcome natural skin resistivity and causing high current flowing

The 1991 HIV-1 study shows that the strength of electrical curent required is in microAmpere strength, which is 1000 times less than the deadly milliAmpere current. 

Next we look at the potential prolonged side effect of applying biocompatible current

### Prolonged effect of electricity exposure

Now that we establish the non-fatal limit of electricity on human body, we need to look into what are the prolonged effect of exposing electricity to human body. The well known effects are:
- [electrolysis][info4]
- [transfection][info5] via [electroporation][info6]
- electrode's biocides

First is electrolysis. Up to 60% of the body is made of water (H<sub>2</sub>O). One of the well known effect of applying electricty on water is electrolysis. When constant static electric field is applied to water, each Hydrogen and Oxygen pole end of water will be attracted to polar opposite of the electric field. If enough strength is applied, it will break the molecular bond, and form hydrogen and oxygen gas on each end of the electric field.


## How could biocompatible electricity be delivered

## Notes To Fellow Reader

**Please do not try to electrocute yourself to cure a viral disease**. People can die from electrocution. The purpose of this article is to explore the working of biocompatible electricity along with its potential side effect, and methods to minimise the side effect and maximize it's damage on pathogenic virus
